Owkwo
-----------------------

An API for all the functions within the www.wer-kennt-wen.de network.
The concept is due to a lack of an open api to construct and parse all the HTTP-Request to gain access to the underlying functions.
For usage in mobile clients like android it will be async and event driven by a delegate pattern.

The API will be quite easy to use:

Instantiate the WKWService class and provide a class implementing the WKWServiceDelegatable interface with all the callback functions or using
the WKWServiceDelegateTemplate and overriding only the callbacks you need.

e.g.
WKWService myWKWServiceAccess = new WKWService(myWKWServiceDelegate);

Call the methods on your WKWService instance and react within the callbacks in your provided delegate.

Callbacks are:

- public void onUpdate(ArrayList<ParentNewsPost> posts, String status );
	
	After using the updatePosts method on the WKWService 

- public void onPost(ArrayList<ParentNewsPost> posts, String status );
- public void onComment(ArrayList<ParentNewsPost> posts, String status );
- public void onLogIn(ArrayList<ParentNewsPost> posts, String status);
- public void onLogOut(String status);
	
Use the status strings (WKWServiceDelegatable.STATUS_SUCCESSFUL and WKWServiceDelegatable.STATUS_ERROR) to check if 
everything was fine with the HTTP-Request and the method call.

The ParentNewsPost list contains all the  news posts and access to the comments related to those via getComments().
