Owkwo
-----------------------

An API for all the functions within the www.wer-kennt-wen.de network.
The concept is due to a lack of an open api to construct and parse all the HTTP-Request to gain access to the underlying functions.
For usage in mobile clients like android it will be async and event driven by a delegate pattern.

The API will be quite easy to use:

Instantiate the WKWService class and provide a class implementing the WKWServiceDelegatable interface with all the callback functions or using
the WKWServiceDelegateTemplate and overriding only the callbacks you need.

e.g.
WKWService myWKWServiceAccess = new WKWService(myWKWServiceDelegate);

Call the methods on your WKWService instance and react within the callbacks in your provided delegate.


iPhone version will follow.
